            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p>
              The idea behind this school project was to create a finished
              product that could continue to be reused by a broad audience even
              after reaching the school course goal. By focusing on this
              concept, the "Is It Only Me?" social gathering game was created.

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
              After an ideation process, whiteboard sketches, and user journey
              mapping the project was transferred to Figma for further visual
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main functionality was set and developed, and features were
              prioritized and embedded step by step.
            </p>
            <p>
              The school project&apos;s goal was to create audio, graphics, and
              immersive web experiences. The timeline for the project was 10
              days with a team of 4 students.

            <h2>My Own Learnings:</h2>
            <p>
              The biggest learning within this project was implementing the GSAP
              framework for the animations within the project, and adding audio
              effects to it. This was a requirement to reach the course goal at
              the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was my second project where I tried to use the Tailwind
              framework. This framework really accelerates the styling approach
              in combination with classic CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create a project from an idea to a ready-to-use product within
              a straight time limits, knowledge gaining on the way, but working
              with a really good team - is possible!
