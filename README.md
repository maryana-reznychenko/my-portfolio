## This is my very first portfolio that I built as Frontend Developer student.

Here gathers the group and individual projects that I built during my education at Hyper Island school e.y.2023/2024.

My Portfolio Site is here: [Maryanas Portfolio](#my-portfolio)

## Tech for this portfolio:

- Rect + Vite as a template;
- Tailwind for styling;
- Framer motion from React for animations;
- Netlify as a deployed environment.
