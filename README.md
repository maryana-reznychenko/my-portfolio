## This is my very first portfolio that I built as Frontend Developer student.

 Here collected and showcased the group and individual projects I built during my education at Hyper Island School s.y.2023/2024.

My Portfolio Site is [here](https://marianna-developer.netlify.app/).

## Tech for this portfolio:

- Rect + Vite as a template;
- CSS + Tailwind for styling;
- Framer motion from React for animations;
- Netlify as a deployed environment.
